# Slasht Text Uploader
A simple Python script in order to upload to the Slimecorp Text Uploader
service aka [slimecorp.biz/t](https://slimecorp.biz/t).

The script is written on a GNU/Linux machine, so usage on other operating systems may vary.

My sister project [slimeshot](https://github.com/akiyamn/slimeshot) is 
intended to take over the purpose of this project eventually.

## Usage
### Unix-like Systems
Simply execute the `run.py` file as follows:
```
./run.py
```
Make sure you have the correct permissions to execute the file.
### Windows
You can execute `run.py` using your preferred method of running Python programs
or you can run the included batch file named `run.bat`.

**NOTE:** *Notifications after uploading text files will not appear yet on Windows machines, eventually this will be fixed.*
